## Git Intro (for DS students) always push to your branch and not master
https://learn.lambdaschool.com/web1/module/rect59e95N6OSvoCd   
**_This is very important for DS students to learn the proper Gitflow_**  
You should always:  
- Create YOUR OWN version of Repo —> (Fork)   
- Add your TL as a collaborator on GitHub  
  - Settings -> Collaborators -> Add Collaborator (use your TL’s handle)  
- Clone YOUR Repo  
  - back on your machine:  
    git clone < your-repo-address >  
- Create a branch (the one you are going to be working on)   
  - cd < repo directory >
  ```
   git checkout -b 'firstname-lastname'
  ```
- Push your new branch up to GitHub and make all future pushes to that branch  
   ```
   git push -u origin firstname-lastname
   ```
  - on GitHub:
    - Compare & Pull Request -> Base: YOUR MASTER (Not the Lambda Master)      
      compare fork: YOUR FORK
- Add your TL as a reviewer on the Pull Request     
  - On the ‘Open a Pull Request‘ page click on Reviewers. 

## What to have done by Monday:
Install python 3 and pipenv (pipenv is the python way of NPM installing- it creates a virtual environment so you can have different versions of python and other things running on different projects) **_HEADS UP: Windows Python installation can be on the more difficult side_**
