# 🤖 Lambda_School_CS_Resource
This is a basic resource list for Lambda School students going into CS. It's broken up according the what should be done by the first day. After that it's broken up according to what materials are covered by which week. Reading Resources are recommended to read when you have time to help supplement.   
**_If you are a student coming from DS, PLEASE review proper Gitflow documented here._**    
**_This is not a complete list. In CS you will be responsible for Googling anything the instructors do not cover in class._**

## Lambda School's Complete CS Wiki:
https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Wiki/wiki

## Git Intro (for DS students) always fork ➡️ clone ➡️ create a new branch
https://learn.lambdaschool.com/web1/module/rect59e95N6OSvoCd   
**_This is very important for DS students to learn the proper Gitflow_**  
You should always:  
- Create YOUR OWN version of Repo —> (Fork)   
- Add your TL as a collaborator on GitHub  
  - Settings -> Collaborators -> Add Collaborator (use your TL’s handle)  
- Clone YOUR Repo  
  - back on your machine:  
  ```
    git clone < your-repo-address >  
    ```
- Create a branch (the one you are going to be working on)   
  - cd < repo directory >
  ```
   git checkout -b 'firstname-lastname'
  ```
- Push your new branch up to GitHub and make all future pushes to that branch  
   ```
   git push -u origin firstname-lastname
   ```
  - on GitHub:
    - Compare & Pull Request -> Base: YOUR MASTER (Not the Lambda Master)      
      compare fork: YOUR FORK
- Add your TL as a reviewer on the Pull Request     
  - On the ‘Open a Pull Request‘ page click on Reviewers. 

## What to have done/installed by Monday:
Install python 3 and pipenv (pipenv is the python way of NPM installing- it creates a virtual environment so you can have different versions of python and other things running on different projects) **_HEADS UP: Windows Python installation can be on the more difficult side_**
https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Wiki/wiki/Installing-Python-3-and-pipenv

**Review Day 1 of Intro to Python (**_This can take a few hours to go through the material for Monday’s lecture_**)**
